# About

A C++ program that converts binary to decimal, text to binary, and text to ASCII numbers.

# Description

- binary to decimal: the user can type a binary number (8 or 4 bits) and the program will convert it to its decimal representation
- text to Binary: the user can type a text, and the program will convert each character to its binary representation (8 bits separated by whitespaces for better organization).
- text to ASCII value: the user can input any text, and the program will convert each character to its ASCII value, separated by whitespaces.
